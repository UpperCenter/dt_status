Global DNS propagation is disrupted currently. Some users are experienceing total outages, while others are fine.

Updates will be posted on Discord\
\
UPDATE: We have now resolved most of the global DNS issues with Google, Verisign and Comodo.

Users should see normal traffic activity return within a few hours.

We will continue to monitor this situation for continued issues

Thank you.
